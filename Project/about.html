        <h1>About the Typewriter</h1>
        <img src="images/typewriter.jpg" alt="Typewriter Image">
        <p>The typewriter is a mechanical device that allows you to write characters on paper. It was widely used during the 19th and 20th centuries before the advent of modern computers and word processors. The typewriter operates by pressing keys that strike an inked ribbon, imprinting characters onto a sheet of paper.</p>
        
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The first commercially successful typewriter was invented in 1868 by Christopher Latham Sholes. It revolutionized the way people wrote and created documents, making the process faster and more efficient. Over the years, the typewriter underwent many improvements, including the introduction of the QWERTY keyboard layout, which is still used on modern keyboards today.</p>
